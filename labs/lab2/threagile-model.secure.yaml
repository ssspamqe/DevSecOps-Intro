management_summary_comment: >
  Threat model for a local OWASP Juice Shop setup. Users access the app  
  either directly via HTTP on port 3000 or through an optional reverse proxy that  
  terminates TLS and adds security headers. The app runs in a container  
  and writes data to a host-mounted volume (for database, uploads, logs).  
  Optional outbound notifications (e.g., a challenge-solution WebHook) can be configured for integrations.

business_overview:
  description: >
    Training environment for DevSecOps. This model covers a deliberately vulnerable  
    web application (OWASP Juice Shop) running locally in a Docker container. The focus is on a minimal architecture, STRIDE threat analysis, and actionable mitigations for the identified risks.

technical_overview:
  description: >
    A user’s web browser connects to the Juice Shop application (Node.js/Express server) either directly on **localhost:3000** (HTTP) or via a **reverse proxy** on ports 80/443 (with HTTPS). The Juice Shop server may issue outbound requests to external services (e.g., a configured **WebHook** for solved challenge notifications). All application data (the SQLite database, file uploads, logs) is stored on the host’s filesystem via a mounted volume. Key trust boundaries include the **Internet** (user & external services) → **Host** (local machine/VM) → **Container Network** (isolated app container).

questions:
  Do you expose port 3000 beyond localhost?: ""
  Do you use a reverse proxy with TLS and security headers?: ""
  Are any outbound integrations (webhooks) configured?: ""
  Is any sensitive data stored in logs or files?: ""

abuse_cases:
  Credential Stuffing / Brute Force: >
    Attackers attempt repeated login attempts to guess credentials or exhaust system resources.
  Stored XSS via Product Reviews: >
    Malicious scripts are inserted into product reviews, getting stored and executed in other users’ browsers.
  SSRF via Outbound Requests: >
    Server-side requests (e.g. profile image URL fetch or WebHook callback) are abused to access internal network resources.

security_requirements:
  TLS in transit: Enforce HTTPS for user traffic via a TLS-terminating reverse proxy with strong ciphers and certificate management.
  AuthZ on sensitive routes: Implement strict server-side authorization checks (role/permission) on admin or sensitive functionalities.
  Rate limiting & lockouts: Apply rate limiting and account lockout policies to mitigate brute-force and automated attacks on authentication and expensive operations.
  Secure headers: Add security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.) at the proxy or app to mitigate client-side attacks.
  Secrets management: Protect secret keys and credentials (JWT signing keys, OAuth client secrets) – keep them out of code repos and avoid logging them.

    justification_cia_rating: >
      Contains personal identifiers and authentication data. High confidentiality is required to protect user privacy, and integrity is critical to prevent account takeovers.

  Orders:
    id: orders
    description: "Order history, addresses, and payment metadata (no raw card numbers)."
    usage: business
    tags: ["pii"]
    origin: application
    owner: Lab Owner

    confidentiality: confidential
    integrity: important
    availability: important
    justification_cia_rating: >
      Contains users’ personal data and business transaction records. Integrity and confidentiality are important to prevent fraud or privacy breaches.

  Product Catalog:
    id: product-catalog
    description: "Product information (names, descriptions, prices) available to all users."
    usage: business
    tags: ["public"]
    origin: application
    owner: Lab Owner
    quantity: many
    confidentiality: public
    integrity: important
    availability: important
    justification_cia_rating: >
      Product data is intended to be public, but its integrity is important (to avoid defacement or price manipulation that could mislead users).

  Tokens & Sessions:
    id: tokens-sessions
    description: "Session identifiers, JWTs for authenticated sessions, CSRF tokens."
    usage: business
    tags: ["auth", "tokens"]
    origin: application

    quantity: many
    confidentiality: confidential
    integrity: important
    availability: important
    justification_cia_rating: >
      If session tokens are compromised, attackers can hijack user sessions. They must be kept confidential and intact; availability is less critical (tokens can be reissued).

  Logs:
    id: logs
    description: "Application and access logs (may inadvertently contain PII or secrets)."
    usage: devops
    tags: ["logs"]
    origin: application
    owner: Lab Owner

    confidentiality: internal
    integrity: important
    availability: important
    justification_cia_rating: >
      Logs are for internal use (troubleshooting, monitoring). They should not be exposed publicly, and sensitive data should be sanitized to protect confidentiality.
